# Krysis MacrosEngine Plugins
Here we will upload all of our **free** [MacrosEngine](https://macrosengine.com "MacrosEngine") Plugins.

## Requirements
All of our MacrosEngine Plugins require the **.NET Framework 4.6**. This will be updated as soon as MacrosEngine upgrades their .NET Framework as well.

Some of the plugins **may require extra files to be downloaded, in order to use the plugin**, e.g *AutoIt* plugin. The reason why we did not embed the required files to the plugins .DLL file is that we simply were not able to do so.

**We created a folder within the plugins folder here on GitHub**, that contains the *files* + a *sample project* created in MacrosEngine, that **downloads these files on runtime**.

**In case you wish to download the required files yourself**, you can also do that. But **we *recommend* that you either use the same methods we did in our sample project, or create your own solution to download these files**. The reason we recommend that is if you or the software *somehow* manages to delete these files, the software will solve its own issue.

Simply **place all the contents of the .zip file within the main directory of your software**. And **to use them within MacrosEngine, simply unzip the file within MacrosEngine's main folder** (where *MacrosEngine.exe* is located.)
