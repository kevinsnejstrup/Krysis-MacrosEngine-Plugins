-- INSTALLATION --

1. Extract all files inside of the "required" folder in to MacrosEngine main folder. (C:\Program Files (x86)\MacrosEngine)
	- It was not possible to pack these files in to the main file.

2. Extract Krysis_AutoIt.dll in to the "Addons" folder of MacrosEngine main folder. (C:\Program Files (x86)\MacrosEngine\Addons)

3. When you compile your bot, you will need to extract all files within "required" to your compiled bots folder.
	- This is unfortunately not done automatically at the moment.
